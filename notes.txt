Kind of API Requests:

GET    - requests.get()  --> Ask for Data to retrieve them from external API
POST   - requests.post() --> Give the external API Data from me.
PUT    - requests.put()  --> Update Data in external API
DELETE - requests.delete() --> Delete API in external API

Header in APIs:

The header is kind of the "header" of a letter. Normally not visible to external users.
I write things in header with a dictionary in python and pass it somehow
